# riot-crud
A flexible CRUD Admin Project.
Inspired by [ng-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin), great if you are familiar with Angular.
Also check out [rfx-stack](https://github.com/foxhound87/rfx-stack) if you like React.

> This is Experimental and under development for my personal needs

If you are interest in alternatives more lose coupled and less full stack go ahead.
